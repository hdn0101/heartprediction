<b>Heart Disease Prediction</b>

<b>Overview</b>

This project aims to predict the presence of heart disease using machine learning models. The dataset includes various medical attributes such as age, cholesterol levels, and exercise-induced pain to determine the likelihood of heart disease.

<b>Dataset Information</b>

The dataset consists of multiple patient records with medical attributes that can help predict heart disease.

<b>Features:</b>

y (Target Variable): Heart Disease (1: Yes, 0: No)

age: Age of the patient.

sex: Gender of the patient (0: Female, 1: Male).

cp: Type of chest pain.

trestbps: Resting blood pressure.

chol: Serum cholesterol level.

fbs: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1: True, 0: False).

restecg: Resting electrocardiographic results.

thalach: Maximum heart rate achieved.

exang: Exercise-induced angina (1: Yes, 0: No) - pain in the chest caused by exercise.

oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest (indicating reduced oxygen levels due to exercise).
